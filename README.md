Application to organize, document and rate McNally's dorky record collection. 
What will this solve? McNally complains about so much, one if which is his lack of ability to immediately identify if he currently owns a record, and if so, what shape is it in? 
McNally finds himself grumpily searching through record bins at estate sales, wondering if he should purchase this copy of Motley Crue's Theater of Pain? Is it better than the 2 copies that I currently own? Will is have less skips? Can I celebrate Home Sweet Home in all it's entirety without wondering if a good cleaning will correct the blemishes in the vinyl? 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
